# Exercise-5

This week we will practice how to create **static and interactive maps using Python**. The goal of this exercise is to allow you to focus on cartographic visualization with Python, and to play around and explore different possibilities of the available visualization packages.

In this exercise, there is no ready-made Notebook-file to start with. All instructions are given in this readme.md -file and you should create all necessary files for completing the exercise yourself. At the end, there should be a notebook-file or a python script file in the root folder, and the output maps for problems 1 and 2 in `.png` and `.html` format uder the **`docs`** folder. Finally, you will publish the maps online (problem 3).

- **Exercise 5 is due by 16:00 on Wednesday the 4th of December.**

- You can gain 20 points from this exercise. 


## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of the AutoGIS course, we would again ask you to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/102086/lomake.html) to help us to continue developing and improving the course.


## Problem 1: Visualize a static map (8 points)

Create a static map using the skills you leared in [lesson 5: static maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L5/static_maps.html). The map should contain multiple layers of data (at least two different data sets), and you should pay attention to the classification and visualization (colors, edges etc.) when creating the map. Write your code into a notebook file (`.ipynb`) or a python script file (`.py`) and store the output map(s) in `.png` format under the `docs` folder.

**Topic of the map:**
- You can either use the data sets we have already used during this course (eg. the Travel Time Matrix, or population grid), or you can select some other data set of your interest (for example, statistics in postal code areas).
- Feel free to adapt examples provided in this course! You can do further calculations based on the datasets or use the analysis outputs that we have done earlier in the course (for example, the dominance areas or travel times for shopping centers). 

**Criteria:**
- The map should have multiple layers on it
- The map should portay some kind of classification and/or an analysis output (not just the raw data).
- Consider [good cartographic practices](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/) (map extent, zoom level, color choises, legend, credit data sources etc.)
- The map should demonstrate skills learned during [lesson 5: static maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L5/static_maps.html) and throughout this course.

**Output:**
- Remember to commit the code and input data (or at least a link to input data)
- Save your map(s) as png image in the **`docs`** folder  

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (10 points)

Create a nice INTERACTIVE map using the skills you leared in [lesson 5: interactive maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L5/interactive-map-folium.html) using either Folium or mplleaflet. Write your code into a notebook file (`.ipynb`) or a python script file (.py) and store the output map(s) in `.html` format under the `docs` folder.

**Topic of the map:**
- You can select the topic of the map freely. **Use your imagination.**
- This map should not be only an interactive version of your submission for problem 1 ;). Create something new!
- Feel free to adapt examples provided in this course!

**Criteria:**
- The map should have multiple layers on it and/or present an output of (simple) data analysis
- Consider [good cartographic practices](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/)
- The map should demonstrate skills learned during [lesson 5: interactive maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/notebooks/L5/interactive-map-folium.html) and throughout this course. You can also take advantage of the [Folium example gallery](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/folium/tree/master/examples/).
- Think about including additional interactive elements, such as popup text in the map.

**Output:**
- Remember to commit the code and input data (or at least a link to input data)
- Save your map(s) in .html format in the **`docs`** folder


## Problem 3: Publish your maps online (2 points)

 You should now have **ALL** your maps stored in the **`docs`** folder inside this repository
- Add links to those maps in the specific Entrance page [index.md -file](docs/index.md) that you can find in the **docs** folder. 
- There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md) 
- Provide a short description of each map in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md)
- Publish your maps with github pages 
  - the url of your maps will be `https://autoGIS-2019.github.io/exercise-5-YourGitHubUsername/filename*`
  - See instructions on **how to edit repo settings and publish contents of the docs folder using github pages** on the course webpages [here](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/lessons/L5/share-on-github.html#sharing-interactive-plots-on-github).
  
  
### Summary of the expected outputs

- Complete the mid-term feedback :) https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/102086/lomake.html
- At least 1 static map in `.png` format stored in the `docs`-folder (problem 1)
- At least 1 interactive map in `.html` format stored in the `docs`-folder (problem 2)
- All codes (`.ipynb` or `.py` -files) and input data (or links to input data) provided in this exercise-5 repository 
- Published maps at: `https://autoGIS-2019.github.io/exercise-5-YourGitHubUsername/filename*` containing online versions of your interactive and static maps (problem 3) 
- Links to the published maps stored in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md) (problem 3)

For both maps, think a bit about the audience of the map, and pay attention to your cartographic choises. Check out [this blog post for further hints on creating good maps](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/).
